# portfolio
ideas, followed by actual design

## Ideas
1. Matrix styele terminal window (like mine) on the welcome/home page. Starts writing cute welcome message. User clicks enter and the webpage loads with cute cmatrix style animation and transition to the actual portfolio website.
2. Dual website with a slider in the middle that allows the viewer to drag left to view the CS aspect of the website (matrix theme, coding projects, repos etc) and dragging right shows the graphic design (projects, commissions, etc) part of the website. This will show my duality, prowess and creative ability with many tools.
