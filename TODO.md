# Things to Change (My Vision)

## Links
- LinkedIn, GitHub, Medium: at the top of the page too

## Menu
- Change to breadcrumb, move to left

## Dark Mode Button
- Move to the top right corner

## Vision
### Background
- CMatrix code
- Then it morphs into your name
  - "NANA AMOAKO_" with blinking cursor
- Thoughts on creating this (maybe after effects)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAtg6HCg54c
- Make sure it's 5 seconds

### Header Text and Description
It will appear after 5 seconds in a fade in style
- Would be typed out using typewriter animation (terminal style)

### Instead of Hire Me/See My Work
- Rounded corners
- Green border
- Black background
- Starts with blinking green underscore (_) animation
- Terminal style (JetBrains Mono):
  "Hit enter (can be replaced with enter icon) to access portfolio"
  * Or just scroll...

## Change 'Trusted by' to 'Worked with'
- Change the animation to a scroll (left to right)
- ASC, AIS, Ashesi Career Services, Npontu, my church, TEDx

## Selected Work to 'What I've Been Cooking'
- Make it sort of like a grid
- The description will go under it instead of on the left side: lowkey not hard because when the window is small that is how it appears (has to be responsive)

## Change 'My Articles' to 'I Write Too'
- Add a subheading '(My Articles)'
- That one leave it like that
- Put a huge Medium button beneath (rounded corners, arrow that shows 'external link', should change color when hovered)

## 'My Toolkit' to 'I'm Familiar With...'
- Subheading 'My Tech Stack'
  - Show the coding languages scrolling like the worked with section
  - JS, Java, Python, CSS, HTML, Git, Jupyter Notebooks, (anything to make you look credential)
- Subheading 'My Design Stack'
  - Show the Adobe Suite, Figma, Canva

## Remove Testimonials for Now

## Change 'Send Message' to 'Connect with Me'
- Put CV on the left 
  - Rounded borders, clickable link to Google Docs or any tracking website (so I can see everyone's email who has opened my document)
- On the right:
  - Huge LinkedIn button
  - GitHub underneath

## Bottom Page
- Place the GitHub, and external icons in the center

YUP THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR NOW
